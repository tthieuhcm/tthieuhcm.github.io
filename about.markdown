## Relevant Experience
- **Research Engineer** (Jul 2020 - present)
__Koidra Inc.__ (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam)
Implement Autopilot - an ML service which helps to control greenhouse climate and crops automatically.
Research on Controlled Environment Agriculture Simulator - a dynamic & differentiable simulator for green- houses and vertical farms.

- **Software Engineer** (Jul 2019 - Jul 2020)
__Koidra Inc.__ (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam)
Implement Krop Manager - a digital decision platform for industry & agriculture.

- **Software Development Collaborator** (May 2018 - Jan 2019)
__Zalo Group__ (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam)
Work as a collaborator for LaBan Team at Zalo Group.
Develop new features for the core application Laban Key - a Vietnamese keyboard for mobile devices.

## Projects
- **(Industrial) Controlled Environment Agriculture Simulator (CEAS):** A fast & high-accuracy digital twin of greenhouses. Furthermore, its parameters are completely differentiable, which means they can be TRAINED using machine learning methods as well. Using vanilla Python & PyTorch for parallel computing + Bokeh for visualizing results.

- **(Industrial) Autopilot:** A service for controlling the greenhouses automatically using our special algorithm. Implement from scratch using vanilla Python. Starting with rule-based control method, our team is trying to apply AI techniques such as model predictive control (MPC) and multi-hierarchy control algorithm

- **(Industrial) Krop Manager:** An digital decision platform using Vue as front-end & Django as back-end. Help implementing the back-end of the first version of the website.
