## Projects

- **(Industrial) Controlled Environment Agriculture Simulator (CEAS):** A fast & high-accuracy digital twin of greenhouses
    * Implement the first version of the simulation with pure Python,
    * Improve the simulation by linearizing calculations & implement matrices of the interplays between components,
    * Make differentiable parameters and batch computing using PyTorch,
    * Visualize results using Bokeh.

- **(Industrial) Autopilot:** An ML service for controlling the greenhouses automatically
    * Implement from scratch using vanilla Python,
    * Implement model predictive control (MPC) and multi-hierarchy control algorithm to solve the optimal control problem.

- **(Industrial) Krop Manager:** An digital decision platform for plants and farms
    * Help implementing the Django back-end of the website,
    * Establish the CI/CD pipeline & test suite for the project
