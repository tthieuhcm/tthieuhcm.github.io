My name is Trung-Hieu Tran. 

I'm a senior at HCMC University of Technology. My major is Computer Science, and I'm interested in Computer Vision and Image Processing.

I made this blog for my further studies because I rarely remember thingy I've learned after one month, so writing is a good way to revise forbid... I mean forgotten knowledge <i class="em em-upside_down_face"></i> Also, my writing skill sucks, so I hope you guys can give me some advice.
